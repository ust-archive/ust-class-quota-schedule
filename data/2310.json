Through case studies on ethical challenges from real-world situations, students will analyze and discuss the complexities of global health practice and research ethics in a global context. This course is co-offered with the University of Southern California. Besides the joint LIVE sessions, face-to-face sessions and group projects are also arranged for the introduction of background knowledge, case studies, group project discussion, and technical support.",

Articulate the important ethical considerations of biomedical research, basic and clinical, involving human subjects.\n2. Outline the unique ethical and social implications of conducting such research in developing countries of different economic status.\n3. Identify key trends and emerging issues in global health ethics.\n4. Analyze situations of ethical challenges in global health practice and research from diverse perspectives.\n5. Appreciate the role culture and religion play in the development of a sense of right and wrong and views on ethics and how protocol fitting to the local context can be justified\n6. Describe best practices in ethical health research and practice to protect human subjects and their legal right"

The physical science basis, impacts, risk, mitigation and adaptation measures of climate change will also be investigated (including technical and social solutions). For local and regional vulnerabilities, such as extreme weather events, sea levels rise, storm surge and coastal flooding, will be covered. The significance of collective learning under the big history framework, both as a driver for our exponentially growing impacts, as well as for better solutions, will be highlighted."

The course introduces how to analyze the performance of public transport systems and road network using classic queuing theory and travel time reliability concepts. The course will complement skills learnt in the other transport courses to provide a well-rounded knowledge of smart transport planning and management. The focus is on the application of transport models in real world settings using real data. Students have the opportunity to work with large open source data in two experiential-learning projects. The course also develops skills for working with data and managing collaborative projects."

It will provide a creative outlet where students can apply their problem-solving skills in a deep and engaging way to create music remixes, mashups, character videos, and reimagined video stories. It will also give students a chance to work with emerging video technologies. Whether students have music and video editing background or not, this course will provide them a chance to create like a sound designer, video editor, and director. For each of their music video creations, students will also create a behind the-scenes commentary video that describes what they did and how they did it. They will share their creations and commentaries in class, and learn from and be inspired by one another."

In weekly large-class settings, students will work with an economics instructor on interpreting and explaining data, applying economic principles to daily life, building and supporting an argument, and evaluating different perspectives in scholarly debates. In weekly small-group tutorials, a language instructor will lead discussions to analyse texts and workshop individual students’ writing. At the end of the course students will be better prepared to undertake independent research and writing in their economics coursework, as well as to write from an economics perspective for a range of non-academic purposes. For BBA(ECON), BSc(ECOF) and BSc(MAEC) first and additional majors students."

It develops a formal macroeconomic framework for analysing the impact of policy decisions and economic shocks on major asset classes - equity, fixed income, foreign exchange, among others. While the framework is global and multi-asset, the focus is on Asia-Pacific equity markets. The use of data, whether it be via the use of factor analysis or the use and interpretation of economic and market related indicators, is emphasized throughout. The important role of central banks and monetary policy in the relationship between policy and asset prices, is a common theme. Real world examples – either current or from first-hand experience – are commonly used alongside theory."

With an emphasis on implementation, computation, and applications, we will discuss the following topics: time-series methods, vector autoregressions with different identification schemes, state-space models and filtering, the solution to and estimation of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models, numerical dynamic programming, and heterogeneous agent models, if time allows. By learning the advanced methods for quantitative macroeconomic research and their applications, students can understand macroeconomic research at the frontier better. It will also help students develop their research ideas and find proper methodological approaches to the questions."

Through hands on work with a simple but fully functional wireless communication system, you will understand the basic engineering tools used and tradeoffs encountered in the design of these systems. This course is centered on weekly laboratories, each designed to introduce an important concept in the design of these systems. The lab sessions are supported by two one-hour lectures and a tutorial that introduce the concepts for the next laboratory, as well as reviewing and expanding the concepts learned in the previous laboratory."

Even two MOSFETs with the same width and the same length, their properties are not identical due to process variations and various non-ideal effects such as layout dependent effects (LDEs) and parasitic elements in CMOS technology. In this course, students will learn about how the above-mentioned effects affect analog circuit performance, and what kinds of methodologies can be used to minimize their impacts."

Major material challenges of emerging energy technologies will also be discussed. During the course, the students will be exposed to 1) the knowledge of material structure-property correlations used in energy technologies, 2) materials synthesis and fabrication techniques for their incorporation into energy devices, and 3) material evaluation principles in energy applications. After taking the course, students will be able to identify desirable material properties and potentially propose new materials and manufacturing methods for specific energy technologies."

The design thinking process modules: empathize, define, ideate, prototype and test, will be introduced and the students will learn experientially by applying these process modules to solve the health unmet needs they observe in real life. The students are required to report their progress throughout the semester. At the end of the course, they will showcase their prototype in a roadshow and submit their project report and reflection on their design journey. It is a common core course for students from different schools who have no background in design thinking or are looking for practical experience in design thinking."

Through small group discussions, in-class activities, personal reflections and individual coaching, this course teaches students to use design thinking to explore many of life’s major challenges, such as pursuing careers they love and finding personal fulfillment. Topics include the integration of work and worldviews, ideation techniques, a portfolio approach to thriving, designing to increase balance and energy and how to prototype all aspects of students’ life. The course also touches on the realities of engaging the workplace, and practices that support vocation formation throughout the career of students. The capstone assignment is the creation of an “Odyssey Plan” focusing on taking actions in the 3-5 years following their graduation. For Engineering students only. Graded P or F."

This course aims to inspire students to take a broader perspective on environmental issues, in addition to advancing the scientific knowledge of climate change and extreme weather. To effectively achieve this purpose, the course introduces the case studies that emphasize the huge implications of extreme events (e.g. drought, flood, heat waves, typhoon) and their linkage with the warming due to greenhouse gases. This course also assesses the potential impacts of climate changes and extremes on social, economic and environmental sustainability through a multidisciplinary approach."

While viable benchmarks and concepts for sustainable development exist, economic decision-makers and financial institutions by and large still focus on economic profit, leaving environmental and societal sustainability outside of their cost-benefit assessments. In order to provide an alternative approach that guides financial investment towards green ventures, the course offers insights into sustainable development concepts and respective assessment mechanisms for sustainable corporate performance. These concepts and mechanisms are exemplified in the Circular Economy (CE) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), which constitute increasingly important elements in sustainable development. By adopting a multidisciplinary perspective, the classes cover the fundamentals of sustainable concepts, benchmarks on how to measure sustainable performance in the economic domain (i.e., at the corporate-, meso- and system-level) and empirical cases on how green finance has and can make a difference to promote sustainable growth."

Amidst the emergence of greenwashing practices that falsely claim environmental preferability, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Carbon Footprinting have become essential tools for providing quantitative evidence of a product's or system's environmental and social impact. This course takes a systems-thinking approach to sustainability issues and explores the application of LCA in a range of areas, including technology development, environmental reporting, investment, and policymaking. By doing so, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of the impact of products and systems over their entire life cycle and learn how to make informed decisions to achieve sustainability goals. The course teaches students the concepts, methodology, and software skills needed to conduct LCA projects and interpret LCA reports. Students will be equipped to apply LCA to promote sustainable development in various contexts."

It is an investment approach that integrates three additional factors - environment (E), social (S) and governance (G), into security analysis and portfolio allocation. As the industry successfully adopts these factors into their double bottom line financial analysis, only a handful of courses - such as this one - would tackle the subject. This course will discuss the market terminology, practices, usages and dollar impact of ESG factors. The main focus is on the identification, measurement and the materiality of ESG indicators. The students will learn that financial analysis with ESG integration provides the basis for a more informed investment decision. Discussion on existing academic papers will shed light on the cost and benefits of sustainable investing. This course will empower the students with cutting edge information, tools and solid research on the subject.",

These foundations are supplemented by several real-world study cases illustrating accounting issues such as revenue recognition, valuation, and failed unicorns.",

Cite relevant case studies to show how and why appealing investments can go wrong.\n5. Integrate micro-foundations, macro-conditions, and market sentiment in formulating an investment case.\n6. Compare and contrast the pros and cons of various valuation methods."

It also aims to foster their self‐understanding and confidence as young adults who can fully enjoy their university education and career thereafter. The course has 3 components: Lectures and Seminars, Self‐Directed Experience, and Advising and Community Meetings. Lectures and Seminars will orientate students to their respective Schools/IPO, provide academic advice and equip them with the scientific bases of well‐being. Self‐Directed Experience will provide opportunities to develop mindsets and habits for students’ physical and social‐emotional wellness and personal enrichment. In Advising and Community Meetings, students will bring knowledge and skills together through reflection and discussion with peers and School/IPO advisors. Topics such as learning and time management skills, purpose of university education, and planning for personal and professional development will be covered. Graded PP, P or F."

Language use, an integral part of human communication, mirrors the inextricably entangled psychological, social, and cultural facets of human cognition and interaction. Building upon a fundamental exploration of the nature of human languages, this course will delve into the closely interlinked notions of language, communication and society as manifested in our daily life, in the context of globalization and increasing border-crossing and intercultural exchanges. Through a lingua-cultural lens, we will probe a range of issues rooted in language and culture: language and thought; identities, self and 'othering'; cultural diversity in verbal and nonverbal communication; language, gender and sexuality; popular culture and global cultural flow; language and power; globalization and language planning and policy in different cultural contexts. Through discussions of such, the course aims to cultivate an appreciation and respect for linguistic and cultural diversity, communicative sensitivity, and social equality."

In the past two centuries, the classical civilizations of East Asia met new challenges: the disintegration of old political systems, the growth of social tensions, and the arrival of an aggressive and expanding West. This course will study the internal and external tensions that undermined the traditional orders, compelling China, Japan, and Korea to seek new political and social reforms. Special attention will be given to the revolutionary changes in society, thought, culture, and the rise of a new political order in twentieth-century China, Japan, and Korea."

How to identify and interpret place names, objects, peoples and animals depicted in the maps, and how to distinguish the real from the imaginary? Who made these maps, for whom, and for what purposes? How were the images of China produced by Chinese different from those by European cartographers?"

Since we will be working with 'concrete sound', students need not have any prior experience in music notation or composition to participate in the course. The course will culminate in an open concert-presentation of final works that students will have developed over the semester."

This is a world which is a product of mobility of people, information and products across physical and virtual boundaries. Languages themselves are changed through migration. Within a context of linguistic diversity, language is central to the organization of institutions, access to information, the exchange of goods and the ability to communicate. Students will investigate how language is used by migrants in areas including health, education, the law and employment. They will explore how language practices are shaped by face-to-face and mediated encounters and by the constraints of political and institutional contexts. Key questions are: What languages and forms of communication get used, when, why and where? What linguistic factors enable and limit access for migrants to services and resources? What are the consequences?"

The process begins by asking students to identify real-world problems through social, business, scientific, and technological perspectives. To add specificity, students will be able to describe the behaviors and needs of social interactions, observe demographic phenomena, assess business viability, and identify and understand technological changes and impacts, etc. After defining a problem statement, students will be guided to generate creative solutions using brainstorming tools and creative thinking skills. Selected solutions will be presented in form of prototypes and open for user feedback. This course emphasizes the appreciation of the role and significance of design for our society."

Students will learn how smart integrative systems are built to sense and interact with humans and the environment, to serve everyday real-world needs. The course includes fundamental theory and also practical hands-on labs and projects for the student to acquire the basic knowledge of designing mechatronic systems, using embedded system to control and practice design thinking process. In the lab sessions, students design and build a succession of mechatronic subsystems, leading to an integrated system in a final project. Lecture topics include embedded system design, basic electronics, use of sensors and actuators, system modelling, measurement and control, and appreciation of the impact of smart mechatronics system in solving real-world problems. In the final project, students will apply design thinking approach to meet the project requirements, specified from users’ perspective."

It covers the relationship between materials and their properties that inform their use in the design of things. We take a design-focused view, expanding the design requirements into an exploration of material properties for given shapes. This will lead naturally into a deeper understanding of functional properties and structures of materials on the one hand, and deformation and failure modes of solid mechanical objects on the other. Various material families, including metals, alloys, polymers, copolymers, and composites will be studied, and a basic understanding of how shape affects mechanical performance will be introduced. In the projects, the choice of optimal materials and shapes of an object will be determined using the design thinking approach. Instructor's approval is required."

Project planning. Distribution of tasks among the team members. Identification of the problem through interactions with the staff of the sponsored company. Ideation. Design concept generation. Selection of ideas. Prototyping. Testing and redesigning. In addition, students have to consider sustainability, manufacturability, and marketability of the proposed product solutions, which have to fulfill needs of the client under a budgetary constraint. Students are expected to spend less time on planning and idea generation as they have already gained these experiences in the second year but more time on prototyping and testing, as this project requires application and integration of more advance technologies and design.

Companies face increasing pressure to become more sustainable from various stakeholders, such as policymakers, shareholders, investors, and NGOs. At the same time, consumers demand more sustainable products and services. While many organizations have established goals to reduce emissions or become carbon neutral in the next 10 to 20 years, they struggle to translate these goals into specific actions and strategies. People in organizations may ask questions like: How do we scope the analysis of our supply chains? What is the proper methodology to estimate emissions? This course will highlight pathways for how you can help build sustainable supply chains for organizations to achieve their sustainability goals."

It provides students with a solid framework and hands-on practice to communicate persuasively and professionally in business settings. In presenting the case problem, analysis and recommendations, students learn to identify issues, develop and organize key ideas, and eventually to persuade the audience of the validity of the arguments and proposed actions. The course sharpens students' ability to explain and support ideas logically, coherently and cohesively using various techniques, to communicate clearly, concisely and accurately, and in appropriate tone and style. Through a range of learning activities involving reading, discussion, writing and making oral presentations, students also develop critical reading, critical thinking and problem solving skills as well as teamwork and leadership skills. For students who have this course as a program requirement."

It provides students with a solid framework and hands-on practice to communicate persuasively and professionally in business settings. In presenting the case problem, analysis and recommendations, students learn to identify issues, develop and organize key ideas, and eventually to persuade the audience of the validity of the arguments and proposed actions. The course sharpens students' ability to explain and support ideas logically, coherently and cohesively using various techniques, to communicate clearly, concisely and accurately, and in appropriate tone and style. Through a range of learning activities involving reading, discussion, writing and making oral presentations, students also develop critical reading, critical thinking and problem solving skills as well as teamwork and leadership skills. For students who have this course as a program requirement."

The course introduces students to research skills using university library resources for finding and evaluating sources for academic writing and speaking tasks. It expects students to be critical readers and writers, synthesizing ideas when developing a coherent argument. The course also aims to develop students’ competence in communicating effectively in an academic community, developing the ability to collaborate both as a member of a group and assuming responsibility as a discussion facilitator in the context of student-led seminars. Throughout the course, students are expected to transfer and adapt their knowledge, attitudes and habits for autonomous lifelong learning."

The principal objectives of this course are to introduce techniques to study random walks on general weighted (potentially random) graphs, and to investigate the profound connections between the behavior of random walks and the underlying graph topology using tools from potential theory, geometric group theory, and electrical networks. Later parts of this course cover selected advanced topics such as local limits of random walks, mixing/cutoff phenomena, or directed polymers. Some familiarity with measure-theoretic probability theory (as in MATH 5411) is helpful, but not strictly necessary to follow this course."

In this course, we will explain the enabling materials science and engineering behind advanced energy technologies by answering questions such as why lithium powers our batteries and why it takes silicon to make a solar panel. Major material challenges of emerging energy technologies will also be discussed. During the course, the students will be exposed to 1) the knowledge of material structure-property correlations used in energy technologies, 2) materials synthesis and fabrication techniques for their incorporation into energy devices, and 3) material evaluation principles in energy applications. After taking the course, students will be able to identify desirable material properties and potentially propose new materials and manufacturing methods for specific energy technologies."

Smart materials are a novel class of materials characterized by new and unique properties that can be altered in response to environmental stimuli. They can be used in a wide range of applications since they can exceed the current abilities of traditional materials, especially in environments where conditions are constantly changing. This course is designed to provide an integrated and complete knowledge of smart materials and meta-structures. The course will also introduce the state-of-the-art advances in applications of smart materials in sensors, actuators, energy harvesters, acoustic transducers, and microelectronic and mechanical systems (MEMS). The course will lay a strong foundation for your future research and career in electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and material science."

The topics discussed are closely related to world-wide current events that affect transnational law and dispute resolution. The lectures examine how domestic laws, and regional and international agreements impact the operations of corporations in different economic sectors (i.e. energy, infrastructure, pharmaceuticals etc,) and in labour relations. The course covers decisions of international courts and arbitral tribunals that affect the activities and governance of private and state-owned multinational corporations. Students will learn how companies can minimize the impact of problematic situations through arbitration, mediation, and alternative means of dispute settlement. The understanding of key legal concepts that govern cross-border trade and investment ensures a holistic preparation to management and business students and enables them to better address complex issues that companies face in a globalised economy."

These relevant foundation models are becoming ubiquitous in solving a wide range of tasks not limited to natural language understanding, notably in generation tasks in computer vision, for instance. These models on the other hand have given rise to new ethical and scalability challenges. This course aims to cover contemporary LLM topics centering around pre-trained language models (BERT, GPT, T5 models, mixture-of-expert models, retrieval-based models), emerging capabilities (knowledge, reasoning, few-shot learning, in-context learning, computer vision), fine-tuning and adaptation, as well as security and ethics. We will cover each topic and discuss important papers in depth. Students will be expected to read and present research papers and complete a research project at the end, in a group of 2-3 students. This is an advanced graduate course and all the students are expected to have taken machine learning and preferably NLP courses, and should be familiar with deep learning models such as Transformers."

Students with more advanced physics background should consider taking PHYS 1312. PHYS 1112 employs a calculus-based approach. Students without knowledge of calculus should take PHYS 1111 instead. Key topics include motions and Newton’s Laws, work and energy, conservation of energy and momentum, rotation, rigid body, simple harmonic and damped oscillations, forced oscillations, standing waves and sound waves, kinetic theory and the laws of thermodynamics. Students without the physics prerequisite but who have taken PHYS 1101 or equivalent, and/or without the mathematics prerequisite but who have taken MATH 1012/ MATH 1013/ MATH 1020/ MATH 1023 or equivalent may seek instructor’s approval for enrolling in the course."

The course will also provide in-depth coverage of the circumstances and main actors behind these reform efforts, and the factors underlying their successes and failures. Considering that Hong Kong itself has been an integral part of the global offshore economy, the course will be useful to those interested in the city’s role as both a major global financial center and a financial gateway between China and the rest of the world. More importantly, it will be useful to those pursuing careers with national regulatory authorities, international organizations, corporate compliance departments, news media outlets, think tanks, consultancies, NGOs, and other public, private, and civil society sector bodies, as well as to those simply wishing to understand the world better and make a difference."

It is deliberately designed as complementary to a formal and theoretically-oriented introductory statistics course. This course introduces basic knowledge about quantitative data analysis from a social scientific perspective, from data generating processes to causal inference. Devoted computing sessions, a signature feature of the course, demonstrate hands-on techniques, such as data extraction, data management, variable manipulation, and descriptive analysis. Students will have the chance to implement ideas and methods from the lectures through in-class exercises, as well as a project, by applying what they learn to real-world data. Upon completion of the course, students should have acquired useful skills for social data analysis as well as a better understanding of quantitative social scientific research. Not to be taken by students admitted to BSc Quantitative Social Analysis from 2022-23 and onwards."

Movies illustrate human lives and feelings in a dramatic way, which often allows us to experience historical events or lives in the other side of the world indirectly. The purpose of this course is to provide an overview of the field of political science and key events in political history by watching movies describing them. Often political concepts such as state, democracy, dictatorship, repression and protest, representation, and election, are considered too abstract or too complicated. Addressing those concepts through movies will allow students to understand those concepts with living examples and empathy. The course explores important political topics and themes including political power and election, democracy, protest and repression, media, corruption, and war. By watching movies, attending lectures, and participating in discussions, students not only learn these concepts but also understand that political issues are part of our society and history and have a substantial influence on individual's life."

It examines both normative justification and reasoned critiques of democracy. It will discuss the normative foundations of democracy, the relationship between individual rights and rule by majority; the procedural and substantive aspects of democracy, and how to conceptualize the common good or public interest in democracy. It encourages students to apply the knowledge of democracy learnt in class to critically evaluate existing political systems and diverse social issues that they face in everyday life. Through in-depth examination of democracy as a normative value, this course will also encourage students to reflect the implications of democracy as a theory to various practical socio-political issues in today’s world."

Major topics discussed in the course include the interactions between legal institutions and the party‐state (i.e., the party and the government), the behavior of legal workers (e.g., judges, police officers), citizens’ use of civil lawsuits and administrative litigation, and some important mechanisms through which citizens or other social actors seek justice in China."

This is an age in which we tend to explain human behavior in terms of our individual achievements, personalities, and even our genetic make-up. The sociologist, however, looks at human behavior as the product of groups, organizations and culture. In order to master this sociological outlook, the course shall examine a number of topics central to our lives from the point of view of sociological perspectives and methods. These topics will include: culture, deviance, inequality, religion, education, social change and development, gender, intimate relations and the family, and power and politics."

The second part introduces analytical strategies for “unconventional” data types, such as social network, web data, and plain texts.

The study of culture is highly interdisciplinary, and this course surveys insights from fields such as political science, economics, public policy, psychology, evolutionary biology and anthropology. We will define the term culture using the tools of social science and discuss questions including where culture comes from, how culture is transmitted, and how culture changes. We then examine the possible implications of culture in areas such as economic growth, public goods provision, ethnicity, and social movement. Throughout the course, will read analyses drawn from many parts of the world, particularly Asia, Africa, North America, and Europe."
